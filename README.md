# Get It Done (with react native)

This small project was a way for me to get some initial experience with react native and expo.

# Tech Used

- React native
- Firebase
    - firestore
    - firebase authentication
- Expo



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ChrisRoach1/react-native-getItDone.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npx expo install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npx expo start
```

**NOTE:**
Be sure to setup firebase config values in a .env file to properly connect to firebase. Email and password authentication needs to be set up within your firebase project to work correctly.
